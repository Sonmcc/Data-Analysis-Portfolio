# Investigate a Dataset

**Tools:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib  
**Skills:** Data cleaning, exploratory analysis, visualization, insight generation

## Overview
In this project, I analyze a real-world dataset to uncover patterns, trends, and potential issues in the data. The goal is to demonstrate how raw data is transformed into meaningful insight through structured exploration and visualization.

## What I Did
- Loaded and inspected the dataset
- Cleaned missing and inconsistent values
- Explored distributions and relationships between variables
- Created visualizations to support findings
- Summarized insights and implications

## Files
- [Jupyter Notebook](Investigate_a_Dataset.ipynb)

## Key Takeaways
This project demonstrates my ability to:
- Work with messy, real-world data  
- Ask analytical questions  
- Use Python to explore and visualize data  
- Translate results into clear conclusions
